## Discord.JS Commando Boilerplate

This is a WIP boilerplate. I'll update it as I learn/do more. 

### Features I *want* to add:
* Model Example
* Axios Example
* Command With Database Example
* Unit Testing
* Basic Commands
* Docker

### Current Features: 
 * Database ORM (sequelize)
 * Logger (winston)
 * Fast Development and Debugging with nodemon 
 * ES6 transpiling with Babel 
 * Code linting with eslint
 
 ## How to use:
 1. Clone or download the repo
 2. Install the dependencies (`npm i`)
 3. Copy the .env.example to .env
 4. Edit the .env file
 5. Run `npm run dev` and start coding!
